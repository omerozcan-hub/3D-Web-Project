## 3D Website
This project was produced using by react and three.js. 

I designed a website made of 3D objects. My goal was to create a site that is more lively and attracts the user's attention. I aimed for the user to get interaction even from the design and spend longer time here. objects can be examined in three dimensions, i.e. they can be moved in a constant circular motion from the center. I didn't create the objects, I got them ready-made from this source.

I used three.js canvas from {https://www.jsmastery.pro/}
